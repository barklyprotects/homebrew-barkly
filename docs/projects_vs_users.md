Projects vs users
=================

In general, anything that a build or runtime dependency belongs in a project.
Anything that is preferential to a user belongs in a user's config.

Simple examples:

| App      | Prefered location |
| -------- | ------------------|
| intellij | user              |
| atom     | user              |
| docker   | project           |
| python   | project           |
